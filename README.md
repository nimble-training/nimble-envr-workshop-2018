Materials for NIMBLE short course at the 2018 ASA ENVR workshop.

All materials for the workshop are here. Given we have just a few hours in the short course, I would like all attendees to do a little bit of preparation beforehand. Please follow these instructions **before** arriving at the short course.

(Instructions under construction...)

  1) Install NIMBLE
  2) Skim through *modules/bugs*, *modules/build*, *modules/mcmc*.
  3) Run the code in those modules to make sure that your installation works and get a sense for basic usage of NIMBLE.

At the very least, please install nimble and either email me or our Google group if you run into problems.
